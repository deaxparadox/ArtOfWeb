# Backend

### Backend Technology 

Backend technology (or server software) coordinates ethe exchange of information between the frontend and the server running a web page. It allows an application to communicate with the main server. The common backend languages are Hypertest Preprocessor (PHP), Ruby, Java, and Python. However, there are many more programming languages and technologies that can be used for differentt requirements.

You can group backend technology into three sub-layers:

##### *API Layer*

The API layer receives interactions from the frontend and them communiates these to the storage layer. This layer acts as a bridge between the frontend and the backend.

##### *Storage Layer*

The storage layer manages and stores an application data. It will communicate with databases to write and read data, while providing access to data. A notification layer will send notifications front the frontend to the backend and vice versa. This allows an application to communicate and trigger responses.

##### Business logic layer

The business logic layer is the main core of the backend. Backend developers configure processing logic in this layer, changing the response a certain API request delivers.
