# Fullstack

Full stack development is the process of developing bot hthe frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component.


### Frontend [read more>>>](/docs/artofweb/108-frontend/README.md)

The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with the application. 

### Backend [read more>>>](/docs/artofweb/107-backend//README.md)

The backend contains the code required for the application to run, including the integrations wit hdata systems, communicating with other applications, and processing data.

----------

Softare developers require slightly different skills, tools ,and software knowledge for frontend and backend development. However, full-stack development combines both disciplines--meaning teams can build application from start to finish in an integrated cohesive manner.

**A full-stack applcation is a software application that encompasses both frontend backend in a single code base**.
